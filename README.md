Analysis and backtesting of quantitative trading strategies using Python (Pandas, NumPy).


# Quantitative Trading Strategy Analysis

This repository documents my self-taught journey into quantitative finance. The goal of this project is to apply my engineering and data analysis background to the financial markets by programmatically developing, backtesting, and analyzing trading strategies.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective

The primary objective is to build a personal framework in Python to:
1.  **Automate Market Analysis:** Move beyond manual technical/fundamental analysis (as practiced on TradingView/Investing.com) to programmatic analysis.
2.  **Backtest Strategies:** Quantify the performance of trading ideas (e.g., moving average crossovers, momentum) against historical data.
3.  **Risk Management:** Implement basic risk management models and analyze strategy performance metrics like Sharpe Ratio, Drawdown, and Alpha.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Stack

This project is being built using the standard Python data science and finance stack:
* **Python 3.x**
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and time-series analysis.
* **NumPy:** For high-performance numerical calculations.
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn:** For data visualization (e.g., plotting equity curves, returns).
* **(In Progress) backtrader / Zipline:** Exploring popular Python backtesting frameworks.
* **(Future Goal) TensorFlow / Keras:** To experiment with ML/AI-based prediction models.

## 📈 Current Status & Next Steps

This project is actively in development.

### Completed:
* Initial research into quantitative strategy frameworks.
* Setup of the Python environment and key libraries (Pandas, NumPy).

### In Progress:
* Developing scripts to fetch and clean historical market data (e.g., from `yfinance`).
* Implementing a simple backtest for a basic momentum strategy.

### Next Steps:
1.  Complete the simple backtester and validate its results.
2.  Expand the framework to test multiple strategies and assets.
3.  Implement performance metric calculations.
